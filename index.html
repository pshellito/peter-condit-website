            Soil texture affects how much precipitation the ground will absorb 
            and how quickly that water will be released into streams or for use by 
            vegetation. The coarse designations shown here are a starting point, but they have drawbacks related to heterogeneity and scale. 
            My dissertation used <i>in situ</i> and remotely-sensed observations to gain a more

          quantify how quickly the ground dries out after rainfall, but my work using data

          out). Small blue markers are from in situ probes and small red markers are from a 
          satellite. Large markers show the median of each observation type, binned by day. 
          Green markers are in situ data thinned to the frequency of the satellite data.

          multi-day drydown periods at locations in Oklahoma and California. Using a time series analysis
          of rainfall data, I identified over 100 drydowns at 17 well-instrumented
          sites in the U.S. and abroad. 
          Small blue dots (appearing as squiggly lines) are <i>in situ</i> observations of volumetric

          NASA’s <a href="https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">SMAP satellite mission</a> 
          measures soil moisture from space. The number of valid observations 
          from three years of operation are shown in panel (a). 
          After using rainfall data to identify drydown events (examples shown 
          <a href="#drydowns">above</a>), I used satellite data to 
          calculate hundreds of soil drying rates at over 75,000 pixels (panel b). 
          The mean drying rates from these satellite observations are shown in panel
          (c). Panel (d) shows the mean drying rates from the same time 
          periods using model simulations. See <a href="./assets/Shellito_et_al-2018-Hydrology_and_Earth_System_Sciences.pdf" target="_blank">

          <img class="photo" alt="Four panels all based on the ouline of the continental US. The first and second (a and b)
                                  have colors indicating counts of satellite observations and soil drying rates,
                                  respectively. Most locations have about 300 satellite observations and 100
                                  soil drying rates. The more forested parts of the country have no observations.
                                  The third and fourth panels have colors indicating soil drying rates, in cubic centimters
                                  per day. There are no data where there were no satellite observations. The two panels
                                  are slightly different, as one is derived from satellite observations and the other is
                                  derived from a model, but they show similar patterns. The fastest
                                  drying rates are in the middle part of the country."

          This continent-wide analysis of monthly average potential evaporation 
          rates and vegetation cover (defined by NDVI) shows heavy dependency on 
          geography. Climates with large seasonal variations in vegetation cover (green subset) 
          experience higher potential evaporation rates when leaves are out 
          (in the summer) than when they have fallen (in the winter). Vegetation 
          in arid regions (red subset) is low all year and does not correlate with potential 
          evaporation. The impact of both regions is apparent in the combined 
          data (blue circles with error bars). See <a href="./assets/Shellito_et_al-2018-Hydrology_and_Earth_System_Sciences.pdf" target="_blank">

                                  annual vegetation coverage. For the most part, the east part of the country 
                                  is more vegetated than the west. There are two insets, one near the great lakes (a humid region),
                                  and one the the southwest (a dry region). The second panel is a plot with vegetation on the x-axis
                                  and potential evaporation (PE) on the y-axis. Three sets of data are on the plot, one from the humid 
                                  region, one from the desert region, and one with error bars showing all data combined. The humid region
                                  shows a strong positive correlation between PE and vegetation. The desert region shows wide variations of
                                  PE but consistently low vegetation. The combined data show a muted impact of both regions."

              After doubling the vertical resolution of a land surface model and 
              comparing it to remotely-sensed observations, I show 
              improvement (blue) and degradation (red) of soil moisture simulations continent-wide. 
              Thinner model layers can improve observability but lead to a dry bias in some regions.

          Remotely-sensed data contain one file for every time step in a given domain. 
          Many types of analyses require aggregating the data into a continuous time 
          series, with one file for each pixel being analyzed. I created and shared
          a <a href="https://github.com/pshellito/smap_data_processing" target="_blank">script</a>
          that uses batched operations to convert thousands of 2-D files into tens
